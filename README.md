The program solves the Collatz conjecture the 3n + 1 problem, and finds a number that has the longest Collatz chain in a given range specified by the user.
It makes use of multithreading for faster computation and provides a GUI for start, stop, and result view.

To open and build the project, just clone all the files to any folder on your computer and run the CollatzCalculator.pro file. Qt Creator will automatically load every project file. All that's left is to build and run the application.

!Important notes!
This project is created on C++ language, using Qt Creator with MSVC 2022 as the maintenance tool. You need them to build and run the project successfully
